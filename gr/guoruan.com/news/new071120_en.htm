                        <h1>GoReat to launch new "web board games"</h1>
    China launched a new version of web software board games (WebGame) is a Web browser-based network of online multiplayer chess game, is play the chess game the browser, it does not need to download the client does not need to install any plug-ins , anywhere, any time any one can access the computer game can be fun, especially suitable for all ages. Department of State Development software company closed closed after six months and arduous development, pioneered Landlords, Texas Hold'em, Stud, beef, bar-Golden Flower, Black Jack, Baccarat and other variety of web chess game, using FLEX + C + + technology chess games compared to the client, the obvious advantages.

<br><div align=center><img src="GuoRuan_Com_flash_bjl.png"  alt="GoReat success of the company website on-line version of Baccarat"><br>HTML version of the successful online baccarat</div>
<br>
<br>Web chess biggest advantage is no need to download the client, you can play directly through the browser, so play up even more convenient. This is for the busy working hours, do not want to download the client is particularly suitable for white-collar class. And because the client does not need to download to personal computers can save some space, do not take up computer resources. In addition, because a web form, you can easily turn on a computer directly on the play, instead of different computers to be installed on the client, and because a web form, it can be aspects of playing time at work (because you can always turn off the page or pages in other coverage).<br>
<div align=center><img src="GuoRuan_Com_flash_zjh.png"  alt="GoReat's website version of the successful on-line bar Golden Flower"><br>HTML version of the successful on-line bundle Golden Flower</div>
<br>
<br>In addition, the page board games can be very convenient access to third party websites (it can open API, third-party web site access, users can play games without the second login), can be divided use this advantage and take the joint operations road, using the general flow of medium and small websites and forums and influence to enhance their own membership, and influence online. This is a chess game client is difficult to do. China launched a new version of soft casual chess game also has a strong web of secondary development, and it can support the needs of the user (or partner needs) Rapid secondary development (client game can also be the second development, but technical issues involved more time-consuming long, but chess game page easier to multi-secondary development), so the situation can be developed for different versions of board games, to accommodate more members and partners needs. China launched a new version of the soft pages of many board games can be achieved with seamless integration of web sites and forums.

<br>
<br>Web game is the biggest disadvantage is that, first, although not to download the client, but when you first open the game speed is very slow, the process has a buffer, so that is not conducive to the player experience. Second, as is the web form, the game quality, the functions of the client can not do as beautiful, diverse, complex. Third, web hosting online chess games compared to client-side game, the less certain, that is, stability of the game worse than the game client, which is the biggest drawbacks of web chess. I believe that as the technology matures, increased bandwidth, these disadvantages will be overcome gradually.
<br>
<div align=center><img src="GuoRuan_Com_flash_ddz.png"  alt="GoReat success of the company website on-line version of Landlords"><br>Landlords successful online web version</div>
<br>HTML version of WebGame chess game platform without installing the software interface beautiful, feature-rich, mature and stable, easy to grasp, easy to play strong, regardless of interface style and some detail has its own characteristics, and the network of other board games there is a clear difference. No need to download and install the web version, without any plug-in, even without registration, go directly to the game, Huan Sheyou free log switch, open the Jiu directly log into the Youxi, convenient, no need to go through a tedious show time, anywhere to open the play. You no longer have to worry about playing games at work discovered by the boss. Not only is the office and home entertainment are a good choice, it is essential each computer should be casual chess games.

<br>
HTML version of WebGame chess game platform though so long as the Internet can play with features, but can not take the traditional download version of chess game and replaced, and because the participation of convenience, decided it was most likely to save the confinement to imprison those who only foot square inch in the high-end office buildings are between the white-collar workers. Players are characterized by white-collar work pressure, play games, less time and effort, but there is enough money in the pockets, they are willing to cast their eyes on the network entertainment money for online games operator point of view, this is clearly more benefits than traditional network games room.

<br>
People access the Internet through the browser, the potential audience are web games, QQ, QQ games one click we can achieve, but there is no such a grand weapon, Ourgame and no. Game and easy way to reach a very close relationship. Similarly, Web Edition WebGame chess game platform, use the browser to simplify the way the game experience to the extreme: people can access the Internet, they can be "no need to download anything, no-cost, non-waiting" to play web games, as long as can enter the URL. This simplification is revolutionary, in sharp contrast with PC online games. PC online games need to download the 100M or more (some even over 1G) of the client, not with the web version of WebGame chess game platform compared to the convenience. Therefore, the web version of WebGame chess game platform has huge potential audience, again simplifying the process of the game experience to the extreme, its development potential can not be ignored.
<div align=center><img src="GuoRuan_Com_flash_sh.png"  alt="GoReat State Stud soft's website version of the successful on-line"><br>HTML version of the successful on-line Stud</div>
<br>Overall, the advantages of web chess is more than disadvantages. I believe the future of chess game client will eventually be replaced by web board games. State board games software company's website now includes Landlords, Texas Hold'em, Stud
, Beef, bar-Golden Flower, Black Jack, baccarat and other games, if you are interested in this game please contact<a href=http://www.guoruan.com>www.GuoRuan.com</A>Customer access to test versions of the site can also directly call 0633-6333363 or email to<a href=mailto:Sale@guoruan.com>Sale@guoruan.com</a>Consultation details.
