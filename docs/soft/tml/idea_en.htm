Catfish Effect, refers to a long-range delivery of live fish fish traders, often arrive at their destinations, most fish are always dying. Later, the fish traders in the live fish mixed with a few live on catfish, fish as catfish, preventing the inside of the fish jump, for fear of bite, the result no one died upon arrival.
More intense competition in IT industry, all kinds of "catfish" too many. Our suggestion is that we come together to study how the "Catfish" exterminate. <br></p><br><br><br>
